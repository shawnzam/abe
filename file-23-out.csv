Book Condition: Very Good. 0312989113 0312989113 From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. Campus politics and intrigue intermingle with sex, suicide and possibly murder in Haddam's searing 20th Gregor Demarkian mystery, set at ""progressive"" Windsor Academy, a suburban Boston boarding school. Alice Makepeace, the ineffectual headmaster's strong-willed wife, has been having affairs with students for years until her most recent conquest, 16-year-old Michael Feyre, is found hanging in his dorm room by his well-connected roommate, Mark DeAvecca. Drugs abound, dress codes are pass? and students call teachers by their first names at the troubled school, which is engulfed in media chaos after Mark nearly dies from arsenic poisoning and a caffeine overdose. Familiar character types on the faculty, including hardcore feminists, closet gays and liberal preppies, hide in their dormitory apartments while Mark's mother, CNN ""talking head"" Liz Toliver, leads an expos? of Windsor's endemic corruption and hypocrisy. Ex-FBI man Demarkian conducts a low-key investigation even while distracted by problems in his romantic life back in Philadelphia. He develops an appealingly close, trusting relationship with Mark that transcends the normal problems of adolescence in this compelling portrait of a closed society rife with sleaze under its veneer of respectability and prestige. (Apr. 18) Copyright ? Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition. From Booklist After years of investigations, Gregor Demarkian has run out of steam. The retired FBI agent just isn't interested anymore in murders, dead bodies, victims, and perpetrators. But all that changes after he gets a call from the 15-year-old son of a friend. Young Mark DeAvecca is a student at a private school; his roommate has just hung himself in their dorm room, and Mark found the body. But that's only the beginning: Mark has been having problems recently, drifting in and out of reality, either from excessive drug use or from an undiagnosed disorder, and the apparent suicide is a notorious drug dealer who has been having a not-so-secret affair with the wife of the school's headmaster. As he weaves his way through the elaborate web of deceit and confusion, Gregor rediscovers his own passion for investigation. After so many adventures (this is the twentieth Demarkian novel), it's an appropriate time for Haddam to address the subject of burnout, and she handles it very well, indeed.

From Booklist After years of investigations, Gregor Demarkian has run out of steam. The retired FBI agent just isn't interested anymore in murders, dead bodies, victims, and perpetrators. But all that changes after he gets a call from the 15-year-old son of a friend. Young Mark DeAvecca is a student at a private school; his roommate has just hung himself in their dorm room, and Mark found the body. But that's only the beginning: Mark has been having problems recently, drifting in and out of reality, either from excessive drug use or from an undiagnosed disorder, and the apparent suicide is a notorious drug dealer who has been having a not-so-secret affair with the wife of the school's headmaster. As he weaves his way through the elaborate web of deceit and confusion, Gregor rediscovers his own passion for investigation. After so many adventures (this is the twentieth Demarkian novel), it's an appropriate time for Haddam to address the subject of burnout, and she handles it very well, indeed.

But that's only the beginning: Mark has been having problems recently, drifting in and out of reality, either from excessive drug use or from an undiagnosed disorder, and the apparent suicide is a notorious drug dealer who has been having a not-so-secret affair with the wife of the school's headmaster. As he weaves his way through the elaborate web of deceit and confusion, Gregor rediscovers his own passion for investigation. After so many adventures (this is the twentieth Demarkian novel), it's an appropriate time for Haddam to address the subject of burnout, and she handles it very well, indeed.

Campus politics and intrigue intermingle with sex, suicide and possibly murder in Haddam's searing 20th Gregor Demarkian mystery, set at ""progressive"" Windsor Academy, a suburban Boston boarding school. Alice Makepeace, the ineffectual headmaster's strong-willed wife, has been having affairs with students for years until her most recent conquest, 16-year-old Michael Feyre, is found hanging in his dorm room by his well-connected roommate, Mark DeAvecca. Drugs abound, dress codes are pass? and students call teachers by their first names at the troubled school, which is engulfed in media chaos after Mark nearly dies from arsenic poisoning and a caffeine overdose. Familiar character types on the faculty, including hardcore feminists, closet gays and liberal preppies, hide in their dormitory apartments while Mark's mother, CNN ""talking head"" Liz Toliver, leads an expos? of Windsor's endemic corruption and hypocrisy. Ex-FBI man Demarkian conducts a low-key investigation even while distracted by problems in his romantic life back in Philadelphia. He develops an appealingly close, trusting relationship with Mark that transcends the normal problems of adolescence in this compelling portrait of a closed society rife with sleaze under its veneer of respectability and prestige.
